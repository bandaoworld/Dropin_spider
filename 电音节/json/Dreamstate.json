 "content": "<p>History\ndreamSTATE was founded in 1995 by Toronto electronic musician Scott M2 (Scott McGregor Moore) who was soon joined by Jamie Todd (aka URM). Their first ambient installation, \"waveforms\" (1996), was mounted in the H5 holographic gallery in Toronto where it played continuously for 6 months. dreamSTATE's first CD release, \"BETWEEN REALITIES\" (1998), was a one-hour excerpt from that installation. They began performing their soundscapes live in 1997 and have continued to be active electronic music performers. In 2000 dreamSTATE began curating THE AMBiENT PiNG, a weekly live ambient performance event in Toronto providing a stage for developing artists in the genre and hosting notable touring performers such as Robert Rich, Sara Ayers, Alpha Wave Movement, Eric Wollo, Tom Heasley, James Johnson and Vir Unis. In 2004 they performed in the Huron Historic Gaol in Goderich, Ontario at the opening of the \"Bread & Water\" multi-media installation, which played for 3 months in the gaol. Their soundscapes from that installation (inspired by the book \"Moon Sea Crossing\" by poet Lynn Harrigan) were released as the CD \"PASSAGE\" in 2005. In 2006 dreamSTATE's concert CD \"OM\" was released, recorded live at the OM Festival 2000 in Tweed, Ontario. </p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p></p>",
