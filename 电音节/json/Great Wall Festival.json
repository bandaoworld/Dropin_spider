While at the Quest, your \"Cashless Wristband\" is not only your ticket in, it's also your digital wallet. By visiting a top-up station, you pay the amount you wish to top-up and can then use your wristband to make purchases with a single tap. In fact, it is the only form of payment accepted by all bars and vendors inside the festival and can be monitored through an app on your phone.</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p></p>",
