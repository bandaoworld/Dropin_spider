It was first held in 2009 and has been held in its current site since 2011. Its diverse line-up of bands, DJs and speakers perform on many different stages each a part of a district with its own unique theming. Each yearly event is known as a Chapter and expands on the storyline from the previous year, told through the sets, live actors and many forms of&nbsp;alternate reality games. The festival site is split into several districts, and the narrative is reflected in the design of the districts, streets and venues, which are populated by hundreds of actors to play the role of inhabitants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The event is centered around a set of common beliefs and principles, mainly supporting the&nbsp;progressive ideas&nbsp;of environmentalism and&nbsp;social equality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The festival is run by Boomtown Festival UK Limited&nbsp;Company Directors&nbsp;Chris Rutherford and Luke Marcus Mitchell, both from&nbsp;Bristol.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\">[4]</sup>&nbsp;The large scale of the sets and infrastructure require six weeks of construction, and a month of disassembly for each event.<sup id=\"cite_ref-fest_Inte2_5-0\" class=\"reference\">[5]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In July 2019, the organisers were granted a capacity increase by&nbsp;Winchester City Council, bringing the total number of people allowed on site to 76,999. This number consists of 58,000 ticket holders, 17,999 crew, artists, traders and guests plus 1,000 local residents with day tickets.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\">[6]</sup>&nbsp;The increase was to come into effect from 2020, until&nbsp;Boomtown 2020&nbsp;was cancelled due to the ongoing&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic.<sup id=\"cite_ref-cancelled_7-0\" class=\"reference\">[7]</sup>&nbsp;The festival planned a reboot of its storyline for the 2021 festival. However, the festival was cancelled once again due to COVID-19, citing the lack of insurance support from the British government in the event that it would be required to cancel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vision\" class=\"mw-headline\">Vision</span></h2>\n<p>A living theatre that ignites imagination and inspires the emergence of a better world through respect, connection, creativity and celebration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\" class=\"mw-headline\">History</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"2000s\" class=\"mw-headline\">2000s</span></h3>\n<p>Boomtown Fair was first created by Christopher Rutherford and Lak Mitchell in 2009 after having grown up in the festival scene.<sup id=\"cite_ref-beta_BOOM_8-0\" class=\"reference\">[8]</sup>&nbsp;<sup id=\"cite_ref-fest_Inte_1-1\" class=\"reference\">[1]</sup>&nbsp;Their experience with&nbsp;music festivals&nbsp;led them to believe that the events they were attending lacked atmosphere, and that many genres were being overlooked, which became a goal for the pair.<sup id=\"cite_ref-leis_Peop_9-0\" class=\"reference\">[9]</sup>&nbsp;The first chapter, Boomtown Begins, took place in 2009 and was held at the&nbsp;Speech House&nbsp;Hotel, Coleford, in Gloucestershire on 7 August. The second event saw the festival move to the&nbsp;Stowe Landscape Gardens&nbsp;in Buckingham, Buckinghamshire and for the third event, the festival was relocated to the Matterley Estate in&nbsp;Winchester, where the festival has remained since.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"2010s\" class=\"mw-headline\">2010s</span></h3>\n<p>The seventh chapter, in 2015, saw the introduction of&nbsp;<em>Psychedelic Forest</em>, the second (first being Tribe of Ffog)&nbsp;psychedelic trance&nbsp;stage.<sup id=\"cite_ref-pint_Fort_10-0\" class=\"reference\">[10]</sup>&nbsp;The 2016 fair saw further expansion with&nbsp;<em>Sector 6,</em>&nbsp;introduced as a way to even the spread of bass-heavy music across the site, and&nbsp;<em>Whistler's Green</em>&nbsp;green fields area over the top of the hill between the&nbsp;<em>Lion's Den</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Downtown</em>&nbsp;areas, mostly secluded from the rest of the site.<sup id=\"cite_ref-fest_Inte_1-2\" class=\"reference\">[1]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The tenth chapter, in 2018, brought the new districts&nbsp;<em>Disorder Alley, Paradise Heights</em>&nbsp;(in place of&nbsp;<em>Mayfair</em>),&nbsp;<em>and Copper County</em>&nbsp;(in place of the&nbsp;<em>Wild West</em>). The same year, festival organisers hoped to increase the capacity of the festival to 80,000, but the application was rejected. Instead they were allowed to open a day early, but only if attendees arrived using 'sustainable transport', in coaches, shuttle bus or cars with more than three people.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\">[11]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In August 2019, Boomtown were granted licensing approval to open a 3,500 capacity event space at their Bristol headquarters, which opened in November as Area 404.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\">[12]</sup>&nbsp;The year's fair installment, chapter eleven, introduced the new&nbsp;<em>Area 404</em>&nbsp;district in place of&nbsp;<em>Sector 6</em>&nbsp;providing the festivals home for&nbsp;techno&nbsp;and&nbsp;acid house&nbsp;music. The event was focused around the \"Leave No Trace\" mantra. Encouraging attendees to take all their rubbish and tents with them as they leave, and also banning single-use plastics from all of the on-side stalls. As a result of this push, the festival saw a 50% reduction in tents and equipment left behind in 2019.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boom_Gree_13-0\" class=\"reference\">[13]</sup>&nbsp;The festival introduced&nbsp;cigarette butt&nbsp;ballot bins as a part of this initiative in an effort to encourage responsible disposal of cigarette butts.

With this change in&nbsp;canon, the event also saw a redesigned layout, consolidating the site into three main areas:&nbsp;<em>The Main City</em>&nbsp;(located in what was previously&nbsp;<em>Downtown</em>&nbsp;&ndash; the Matterley Bowl), The Forests and Woodland areas, and the Campsites and their villages. The move meant that the majority of stages and venues were now located within the natural bowl, with the campsites able to occupy more of the flat land in the surrounding landscape.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boom_Chap_16-0\" class=\"reference\">[16]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After an announcement from Prime Minister&nbsp;Boris Johnson&nbsp;on Monday, 22 February announcing the roadmap for the removal of restrictions in England, public confidence in the 2021 festival season increased.<sup id=\"cite_ref-bbc._Lock_17-0\" class=\"reference\">[17]</sup>&nbsp;Following this news, many festivals in the UK saw a huge increase in ticket sales, with the organisers of the&nbsp;Reading and Leeds festivals&nbsp;stating they were 'very confident' the summer's events would go ahead.<sup id=\"cite_ref-theg_Fest_18-0\" class=\"reference\">[18]</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-bbc._Read_19-0\" class=\"reference\">[19]</sup>&nbsp;By Thursday 25 February, all remaining Boomtown tickets had sold out, it was later revealed that 48,000 tickets were sold in total.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boom_Wear_20-0\" class=\"reference\">[20]</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-21\" class=\"reference\">[21]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On 20 April 2021 however, Boomtown announced that it would be cancelled for the second year in a row. Organisers cited the lack of a government insurance scheme to cover COVID-19-related cancellations of music festivals, stating that \"for an independent event as large and complex as Boomtown, this means a huge gamble into an eight-figure sum to lose if we were to venture much further forward, and then not be able to go ahead due to COVID.\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cancelled_2021_22-0\" class=\"reference\">[22]</sup>&nbsp;While the organizers planned to hold a smaller event known as Boom Village in August, on 14 July notwithstanding the lifting of restrictions in the UK, Boom Village was cancelled due to safety concerns over rising numbers of new COVID-19 cases.<sup id=\"cite_ref-23\" class=\"reference\">[23]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ethos_and_values\" class=\"mw-headline\">Ethos and values</span></h2>\n<p>The event is centered around a set of common beliefs and principles, mainly supporting the&nbsp;progressive ideas&nbsp;of environmentalism and&nbsp;social equality.The event explicitly defines these ethos through the event's vision code, referred to as&nbsp;<em>The Six Pillars of Boomtown</em>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-boom_Etho_24-0\" class=\"reference\">[24]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Respect Yourself</strong>: In a world that can make us doubt our own worth, we want to provide a space for self-empowerment and freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Respect Each Other</strong>: In a world that is deeply scarred by the open wounds of racism and prejudice, we want people of all backgrounds, beliefs, ages, gender identities, sexual orientations, abilities and races to know that you belong and are safe in our city.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Respect the Planet</strong>: In a world that is burning, we call on our collective humanity to come together to find solutions and care for nature, as she cares for us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Creativity</strong>: In a world where conformity is valued over creativity, we want to provide a platform that nurtures artistic freedom and pushes the boundaries of creative expression.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong>: In a world where digital connection so often replaces physical connection, we cherish the depth of togetherness that comes from the gatherings of humans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Celebration</strong>: In a world that can so often feel overloaded with negativity, we want to celebrate the very best this beautiful planet and all humanity can achieve, in one almighty party where everyone's welcome!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Layout\" class=\"mw-headline\">Layout</span></h2>\n<p>Across the four areas of&nbsp;<em>Temple Valley</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hilltop</em>,&nbsp;<em>Downtown</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Forgotten Valley</em>&nbsp;there are 14 unique districts, each with a unique identity seen through the&nbsp;set dressing, wandering&nbsp;theatrical performances, and&nbsp;music genres&nbsp;on show.
