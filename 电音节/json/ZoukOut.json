The three headline acts performed at ZoukOut 2010 were multi-platinum selling artiste David Guetta, world-renowned trance DJ Tiësto and Grammy award-winning DJ Jazzy Jeff. The 10th anniversary saw a record attendance of 28,000 party-goers. As a result of such high demand from people wanting to attend and its growth in popularity, ZoukOut set out to hold the event from 2012 on a two-day basis (Friday & Saturday).\n\nZoukOut has since held the festival for two-days at Siloso Beach, Sentosa over the past few years.
