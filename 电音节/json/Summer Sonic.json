Among the first bands in 2000's lineup were 311, Arrested Development, At the Drive-In, Ben Folds Five, and Coldplay.\r\n\r\nThe EDM section of the festival was later split into Sonicmania which is held at Makurai Messe the day before the festival, which according to Time Out, \"Held as a warm-up for Summer Sonic each year, the all-night Sonicmania party caters to dance kids who aren't so well served by the main festival itself\"[1] in 2011.[2]\r\n\r\nProducer Creativeman formed a joint venture with Live Nation Entertainment in 2012.[3] Live Nation bought full control of the venture in 2014.[4]\r\n\r\nIn 2017, the festival was expanded to Shanghai, China.[5]</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p></p>",
