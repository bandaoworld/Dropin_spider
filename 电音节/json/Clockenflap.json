Their stated goals for the festival are to nurture the Hong Kong arts, music and film scene[1] and \"put the city on Asia's contemporary media-arts circuit\".[2] The NME credits Clockenflap for the \"pioneering role it has played in nurturing the Hongkong indie and alternative music scenes, as well as bringing International talent to Hongkong audiences\".[3]\r\n\r\nThe first Clockenflap festival was held in a concrete public space in an empty housing development called \"Cyberport\", in front of 1500 attendees.[4] It later expanded to the West Kowloon Cultural District.\r\n\r\n</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p>null</p>\n\r<p></p>",
