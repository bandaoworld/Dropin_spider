Due to the positive feedback from the event, especially from young foreign expatriate residents in the dj scene, Idea Masters, an events promoter returned the following year with a much larger, paid admission event located at the current site.\n\nThe event was recognized as becoming one of the largest festivals in Korea, as it has attracted more than 90,000 people over three days in 2007.It featured a live concert, a dance party, and a world rhythm festival.\n2008\n\nThe DJ festival showcased numerous DJs from around the world, and in a break from other festivals or events in the Seoul area, encouraged people to dance all night and into the morning. Artists, performers and fans of all tastes and genres including electronica, rock & roll, international, attended and showed their enthusiasm.\n\nUnlike the first event in 2007, the following year became independently operated and required paid admission.
