 "contentEn": "<p>Faster (~190-240) Rawstyle, Originally was the style of Partyraiser - a veteran Hardcore DJ that was notorious for playing B-sides of records pitched up very fast. It started to become its own distinct style and got the name \"Uptempo\" around 2012-ish. Production is often unpolished/lower quality, but keeps the vibe, spirit, and intensity of Rawstyle. Fast-paced leads/screeches, biting/raspy kicks, and rarely any melodies. People started experimenting with punchless kicks, higher pitched kicks, lower frequency kicks and slower bpm's around 2019, predominantly The Dark Horror and Dimitri K. Uptempo Hardcore is similar to Rawstyle and Xtra Raw.</p>",
