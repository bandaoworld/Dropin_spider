 "content": "<p>Ableton Live是一套以loop为基础的Music Sequencer，可在Macintosh及Windows上执行。相比于其他的Software Sequencer，Live设计出来多数是用来作实时乐器演奏多于作为一个作曲及编曲的工具。从它的名字就可得知。</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>历史</strong></p>\n<p>Live原本是在Max/MSP中设计的。由于想把它定位在商业的用途上，Ableton在1999年由Gerhard Behles，Monolake的Robert Henke及Bernd Roggendorf所创立。Live被重新在C++中编写成一套商业的软件，第一版是在2001年推出的。截至2006年9月，Live已推出到6.01版。Ableton也同时开发了另一套软件，Operator，一套在Live中用作音频合成乐器的产品。现时Ableton的首席执行官是Behles，而技术总监是Henke，他也专注于Live's当中内置的效果器及乐器。Ableton's的总部位于柏林中部。</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>功能</strong></p>\n<p>大部分Live's的独特界面都是设计成用于实时表演的。它的界面比实际的sequencers更加小巧及清晰，以便在一个萤幕中使用。更完美的是它不会弹出讯息框及对话框。有部分的界面是可随着鼠标的控制作出弹性隐藏及显示 {如：隐藏乐器／效果器列表或显示／隐藏帮助框）。另外，因为Live's是设计来用在表演用途，所以所有它的音效处理都是实时的，与其他普通需要预先演算的sequencers及sample编辑器不同。</p>",
 "contentEn": "<p><strong>Ableton Live</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;digital audio workstation&nbsp;for&nbsp;macOS&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;developed by Berlin-based&nbsp;Ableton. In contrast to many other&nbsp;software sequencers, Ableton Live is designed to be an&nbsp;instrument&nbsp;for live&nbsp;performances&nbsp;as well as a tool for&nbsp;composing,&nbsp;recording,&nbsp;arranging,&nbsp;mixing, and&nbsp;mastering. It is also used by&nbsp;DJs, as it offers a suite of controls for&nbsp;beatmatching,&nbsp;crossfading, and other different effects used by&nbsp;turntablists, and was one of the first music applications to automatically beatmatch&nbsp;songs. Live is available in three editions: Intro (with limited key features), Standard, and Suite.<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\">[3]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\" class=\"mw-headline\">History</span></h2>\n<p>Ableton co-founders Gerhard Behles,&nbsp;Robert Henke, and Bernd Roggendorf developed Live from homemade software that Behles and Henke had created to facilitate their live music performances as&nbsp;Monolake. They released the first version of Live in 2001 as&nbsp;commercial software.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\">[4]</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-5\" class=\"reference\">[5]</sup>&nbsp;Ableton Live is written in&nbsp;C++. Live itself was not prototyped in&nbsp;Max, although most of the audio devices were.<sup id=\"cite_ref-6\" class=\"reference\">[6]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Features\" class=\"mw-headline\">Features</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Views\" class=\"mw-headline\">Views</span></h3>\n<p>Live's user interface is composed of two 'Views' &ndash; the Arrangement View and the Session View. Live utilizes audio&nbsp;sample&nbsp;or&nbsp;MIDI&nbsp;sequences, referred to as Clips, which are arranged to be played live (i.e. triggered) or played back in a pre-arranged order.&nbsp;MIDI&nbsp;triggers notes on Live's built in instruments, as well as third party VST instruments or external hardware.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Session View offers a grid-based representation of all of the Clips in a Live Set. These clips can be arranged into scenes which can then be triggered as a unit. For instance a&nbsp;drum,&nbsp;bass&nbsp;and&nbsp;guitar&nbsp;track might comprise a single scene. When moving on to the next scene, which may feature a&nbsp;synth bassline, the artist will trigger the scene, activating the clips for that scene.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Arrangement View offers a horizontal music production timeline of Clips that is more similar to a traditional software sequencer interface. The Arrangement View is used for recording tracks from the session view and further manipulating their arrangement and effects. It is also used for manual MIDI sequencing.<sup id=\"cite_ref-7\" class=\"reference\">[7]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Instruments\" class=\"mw-headline\">Instruments</span></h3>\n<p>The Intro version of Live includes four instruments (Impulse, Simpler, Instrument Rack, and Drum Rack) and the Standard version of Live additionally includes External Instrument, with users having the option to purchase additional instruments. By contrast, Live Suite includes all available instruments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Impulse</strong>&nbsp;- a traditional drum triggering instrument which allows the user to define a kit of up to eight drum sounds, each based on a single sample. There are a number of effects available such as basic equalization, attack, decay, pitch shift, etc. Once the kit is defined, rhythms and beats are created through Live's MIDI sequencer.</li>\n<li><strong>Simpler</strong>&nbsp;- a basic&nbsp;sampling&nbsp;instrument. It functions using a single audio sample, applying simple effects, and envelopes, finally applying pitch transformations in the form of&nbsp;Granular synthesis. In this case, incoming MIDI does not trigger drums as it does in&nbsp;<em>Impulse</em>, but selects the final pitch of the sample, with C3 playing the sample at its original pitch.</li>\n<li><strong>Drum Rack</strong>&nbsp;- a sampler for drums. MIDI notes trigger individual \"Simplers\" so rather than triggering one sample at multiple pitches, individual samples are triggered at predefined pitches, as is suitable for MIDI drum programming. As is usual with Ableton almost anything can be drag dropped to or from the drum racks; for example, one can drop an audio clip or any MIDI device onto a drum rack note.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrument Rack</strong>&nbsp;- allows the user to combine multiple instruments and effects into a single device, allowing for split and layered sounds with customized macro controls.</li>\n<li><strong>Analog</strong>&nbsp;- simulates an&nbsp;analog synthesizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Bass</strong>&nbsp;- a monophonic virtual analog bass synthesizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Collision</strong>&nbsp;- a mallet&nbsp;percussion&nbsp;physical modelling synthesizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Drum Synths</strong>&nbsp;- 8 devices for creating drum and percussion sounds via synthesis.</li>\n<li><strong>Electric</strong>&nbsp;- an&nbsp;electric piano&nbsp;instrument.</li>\n<li><strong>Operator</strong>&nbsp;- an&nbsp;FM synthesizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Poli</strong>&nbsp;- a virtual analog synthesizer that combines&nbsp;subtractive&nbsp;and&nbsp;FM synthesis</li>\n<li><strong>Sampler</strong>&nbsp;- an enhanced&nbsp;sampler.</li>\n<li><strong>Tension</strong>&nbsp;- a string&nbsp;physical modelling synthesizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Wavetable</strong>&nbsp;- a&nbsp;wavetable synthesizer&nbsp;featuring two oscillators and re-mappable modulation sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ableton also has available a massive selection of&nbsp;<strong>Add-on Sample Packs</strong>&nbsp;with which a user can expand the sound libraries for their instruments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Session Drums</strong>&nbsp;- a collection of sampled&nbsp;drum kits.</li>\n<li><strong>Latin Percussion</strong>&nbsp;- a collection of sampled&nbsp;latin percussion&nbsp;hits and loops.</li>\n<li><strong>Essential Instruments Collection</strong>&nbsp;- a large collection of acoustic and electric instrument samples.</li>\n<li><strong>Orchestral Instrument Collection</strong>&nbsp;- a collection of four different orchestral libraries, which can be purchased individually or as a bundle: Orchestral Strings, Orchestral Brass, Orchestral Woodwinds and Orchestral Percussion. The Orchestral Instrument Collection is included upon purchase of Live Suite but must be downloaded separately.[8]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Dedicated_hardware_instruments\" class=\"mw-headline\">Dedicated hardware instruments</span></h3>\n<p>Akai&nbsp;Professional makes the APC40 mk II, a MIDI controller designed to work solely with Ableton Live. A smaller version, the APC20, was released in 2010. Though there are many MIDI controllers compatible with Ableton, these Akai units try to closely map the actual Ableton Live layout onto physical space.&nbsp;Novation Digital Music Systems&nbsp;has created the \"Launchpad\" which is a pad device that has been designed for use with Ableton. There are currently four different Launchpad models: Launchpad Mini, Launchpad X, Launchpad Pro, and Launchpad Control. Ableton has also released their own&nbsp;MIDI&nbsp;controller, the&nbsp;Push, which is the first pad-based controller that embraces scales and melody.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\">[9]</sup>&nbsp;In November 2015, Ableton released an updated&nbsp;MIDI&nbsp;controller, the&nbsp;Push 2, along with Live 9.5.<sup id=\"cite_ref-10\" class=\"reference\">[10]</sup>&nbsp;Push 2, in terms of its design, features a new colorful display, improved buttons and pads, and a lighter frame.<sup id=\"cite_ref-11\" class=\"reference\">[11]</sup></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Effects\" class=\"mw-headline\">Effects</span></h3>\n<p>Most of Live's&nbsp;effects&nbsp;are already common effects in the&nbsp;digital signal processing&nbsp;world which have been adapted to fit Live's interface. They are tailored to suit Live's target audience &ndash;&nbsp;electronic musicians&nbsp;and&nbsp;DJs&nbsp;- but may also be used for other recording tasks such as processing a guitar rig. The effects featured in Ableton Live are grouped into two categories - MIDI effects and audio effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Working_with_audio_clips\" class=\"mw-headline\">Working with audio clips</span></h3>\n<p>In addition to the instruments mentioned above, Live can work with samples. Live attempts to do beat analysis of the samples to find their&nbsp;meter, number of bars and the number of&nbsp;beats per minute. This makes it possible for Live to shift these samples to fit into&nbsp;loops&nbsp;that are tied into the piece's global&nbsp;tempo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Live's Time Warp feature can be used to either correct or adjust beat positions in the sample. By setting warp markers to a specific point in the sample, arbitrary points in the sample can be pegged to positions in the measure. For instance a drum beat that fell 250 ms after the midpoint in measure may be adjusted so that it will be played back precisely at the midpoint.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some artists and online stores, such as The Covert Operators and Puremagnetik, now make available sample packs that are pre-adjusted, with tempo information and warp markers added. The audio files are accompanied with an \"analysis file\" in Live's native format (.asd files).<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\">[12]</sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-13\" class=\"reference\">[13]</sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ableton Live also supports Audio To MIDI, which converts audio samples into a sequence of MIDI notes using three different conversion methods including conversion to Melody, Harmony, or Rhythm. Once finished, Live will create a new MIDI track containing the fresh MIDI notes along with an instrument to play back the notes. Audio to midi conversion is not always 100% accurate and may require the artist or producer to manually adjust some notes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-14\" class=\"reference\">[14]</sup>&nbsp;See&nbsp;Fourier transform.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Envelopes\" class=\"mw-headline\">Envelopes</span></h3>\n<p>Almost all of the parameters in Live can be automated by envelopes which may be drawn either on clips, in which case they will be used in every performance of that clip, or on the entire arrangement. The most obvious examples are volume and track panning, but envelopes are also used in Live to control parameters of audio devices such as the root note of a resonator or a filter's cutoff frequency. Clip envelopes may also be mapped to&nbsp;MIDI&nbsp;controls, which can also control parameters in real-time using sliders, faders and such. Using the global transport record function will also record changes made to these parameters, creating an envelope for them.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><span id=\"User_interface\" class=\"mw-headline\">User interface</span></h3>\n<p>Much of Live's interface comes from being designed for use in live performance, as well as for production.<sup id=\"cite_ref-15\" class=\"reference\">[15]</sup>&nbsp;There are few pop up messages or dialogs. Portions of the interface are hidden and shown based on arrows which may be clicked to show or hide a certain segment (e.g. to hide the instrument/effect list or to show or hide the help box).</p>\n<p>Live now supports latency compensation for plug-in and mixer automation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\" class=\"mw-headline\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"reflist\">\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\">\n<ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><strong>^</strong></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"reference-text\"><cite class=\"citation web cs1\">\"Live 11 Release Notes\"<span class=\"reference-accessdate\">.
